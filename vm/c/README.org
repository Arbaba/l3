#+TITLE: The L₃ virtual machine

* Introduction

This directory contains the source code of the L₃ virtual machine, written in C.

* Compiling

To compile the virtual machine, use the provided =Makefile= with the =vm= target:

: $ make vm

* Running

Once compiled, the virtual machine can be found in the =bin= directory. It takes an assembly file produced by the compiler as argument and runs it, e.g.:

: $ ./bin/vm ../compiler/out.l3a

It also accepts the =-m= option to set the total memory size (code and heap), in bytes.
